&lt;p>On the 3 December 2022, we launched our very first PsyConnect: Life After Graduation series where we invited 3 alumni to share their personal experience in SUSS and in their current workplace, followed by a Q&amp;amp;A session to conclude their sharing.
The 3 alumni that shared were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Raj Rajendran, Psychiatric Case Manager, IMH&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Chloe Tay, Associate Psychologist, Viriya Community Services&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Bryan Chan, Research Associate, SUSS&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Shortly after the sharing by our alumni, a token of appreciation was given to them by our Associate Professor and Head of Psychology Programme, Dr Emily Ortega. Next, students participated in a game of Kahoot which tested on the information/details of the specific fields shared by the alumni (i.e., Psychiatric Case Manager, Associate Psychologist, Research Associate), of SUSS, and of PsyConnect. The top 3 winners of the Kahoot quiz received prizes, given out by Dr Atiqah, the Faculty Advisor to PsyConnect.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The event then ended with a networking session where students, alumni and faculty members mingled and bonded with one another over some food and drinks.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PsyConnect Plays!</title><link>https://psyconnect.github.io/event/psyconnect-plays-november-2022/</link><pubDate>Sat, 26 Nov 2022 13:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://psyconnect.github.io/event/psyconnect-plays-november-2022/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 26 November 2022, PsyConnect organised a board games cum social networking event just after the exams! (Wew, finally got to catch our breaths!)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Students, both old and new, got to meet one another, exchanged contacts and have fun together! We hope to see you guys soon :).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Mental Wellness @ Singapore Botanic Gardens</title><link>https://psyconnect.github.io/event/botanic-gardens-wellness/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Aug 2022 16:00:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://psyconnect.github.io/event/botanic-gardens-wellness/</guid><description>&lt;p>On the 13th of August 2022, PsyConnect organised a wellness event that was centered around nature. This event took place at Botanic Gardens where students got to engage in a few destressing activities and interacting with other students over games and snacks.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Furthermore, two members of PsyConnect shared their own personal struggles with stress/anxiety and how they managed those emotions. One helpful and practical takeaway is the mindful practice of grounding (with your 5 senses):&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>5 things you can &lt;strong>see&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>4 things you can &lt;strong>touch&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>3 things you can &lt;strong>hear&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>2 things you can &lt;strong>smell&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>1 thing you can &lt;strong>taste&lt;/strong>&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>

Fortunately, with the recent loosening of Covid-19 measures, we were finally able to hold our first ever board games edition of “PsyConnect Plays!” on-site at Settler’s cafe on the 19th December 2021.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, with the Covid-19 protocols in place so as to ensure the safety of everyone even as we have fun! What a jolly way to start this Christmas season with many new faces and exchanges of laughter!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>PsyConnect Movie Screening - Starred Up</title><link>https://psyconnect.github.io/event/starred-up-psyconnect-movie/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Jun 2022 14:45:00 +0800</pubDate><guid>https://psyconnect.github.io/event/starred-up-psyconnect-movie/</guid><description>&lt;p>We were thankful to have A/P Timothy Leo (from our Master’s in Forensic Psychology programme) join us to review the movie “Starred Up” through the lenses of a Psychologist in a Forensic setting.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>“Starred Up” is a prison crime drama film based in London. It revolves around the life of a young offender who got transferred into an adult prison prematurely. The film explores the challenges in rehabilitation work with violent offenders struggling with dysfunctional parent-child relationships as well as the effects of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>After the movie, A/P Timothy Leo shared with us his experiences gleaned over the many years of working with offenders locally and abroad. Throughout the session, students were able to clarify doubts and raise questions during the Q&amp;amp;A session. At the end of the event, our students learned more about psychological work in the forensic setting.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>

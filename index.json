The film explores the challenges in rehabilitation work with violent offenders struggling with dysfunctional parent-child relationships as well as the effects of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE).\nAfter the movie, A/P Timothy Leo shared with us his experiences gleaned over the many years of working with offenders locally and abroad.

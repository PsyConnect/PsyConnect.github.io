On the 13th of August 2022, PsyConnect organised a wellness event that was centered around nature. This event took place at Botanic Gardens where students got to engage in a few destressing activities and interacting with other students over games and snacks. 

Furthermore, two members of PsyConnect shared their own personal struggles with stress/anxiety and how they managed those emotions. One helpful and practical takeaway is the mindful practice of grounding (with your 5 senses):
* 5 things you can **see**
* 4 things you can **touch**
* 3 things you can **hear**
* 2 things you can **smell**
* 1 thing you can **taste**

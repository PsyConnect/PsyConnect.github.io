We were thankful to have A/P Timothy Leo (from our Master’s in Forensic Psychology programme) join us to review the movie “Starred Up” through the lenses of a Psychologist in a Forensic setting.

“Starred Up” is a prison crime drama film based in London. It revolves around the life of a young offender who got transferred into an adult prison prematurely. The film explores the challenges in rehabilitation work with violent offenders struggling with dysfunctional parent-child relationships as well as the effects of Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACE).

After the movie, A/P Timothy Leo shared with us his experiences gleaned over the many years of working with offenders locally and abroad. Throughout the session, students were able to clarify doubts and raise questions during the Q&A session. At the end of the event, our students learned more about psychological work in the forensic setting.

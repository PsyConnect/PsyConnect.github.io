PsyConnect: Life After Graduation is a series of sharing by speakers about the career trajectories in the field of Psychology, and the specifics of their respective work.

On the 3 December 2022, we launched our very first PsyConnect: Life After Graduation series where we invited 3 alumni to share their personal experience in SUSS and in their current workplace, followed by a Q&A session to conclude their sharing.
The 3 alumni that shared were:

1. Raj Rajendran, Psychiatric Case Manager, IMH
2. Chloe Tay, Associate Psychologist, Viriya Community Services
3. Bryan Chan, Research Associate, SUSS

Shortly after the sharing by our alumni, a token of appreciation was given to them by our Associate Professor and Head of Psychology Programme, Dr Emily Ortega. Next, students participated in a game of Kahoot which tested on the information/details of the specific fields shared by the alumni (i.e., Psychiatric Case Manager, Associate Psychologist, Research Associate), of SUSS, and of PsyConnect. The top 3 winners of the Kahoot quiz received prizes, given out by Dr Atiqah, the Faculty Advisor to PsyConnect.

The event then ended with a networking session where students, alumni and faculty members mingled and bonded with one another over some food and drinks.

Dr Atiqah is a Faculty (Lecturer) at the Singapore University of Social Sciences who examines brain and behavioural mechanisms of interpersonal relationships when people engage in real-world activities in naturalistic settings. 

She is keen to discover dyadic and group based interpersonal neural markers which could be predictive of important outcomes, such as quality of relationships, collaboration, performance and learning. 

Some of her latest work have examined the effects of physical presence on interpersonal neural synchrony (INS; similarities in brain signals) of couples, the effects of parenting stress and attachment on parent-child dyads when they engage in everyday activities like watching movies and playing together, and the role of parent-facilitated conversations with their child about in-group, out-group and multicultural Singaporean narratives.
